speed of gravity,universe,"A research theam in China announced that it had produced measurements of the phse lag of Earth tides during full and new moons which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light. This means that if the Sun suddenly dissapears; the Earth would keep orbiting the vacant point nomrally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to travel that distance. The team's findings were released in Science Bulletin in February 2012.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity,,"2012, 2013, 2017",
