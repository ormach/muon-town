classical mechanics,y,y,Branch of physics that deals with the motion of macroscopic objects under the influence of forces| following principles established by Isaac Newton.,science| branch| physics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics,,,,,,
dynamics,y,y,A branch of mechanics that deals with forces and their relation primarily to the motion but sometimes also to the equilibrium of bodies.,science| branch| mechanics,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dynamics,,,,,,
statics,y,y,Branch of classical mechanics that is concerned with the analysis of force and torque acting on a physical system that does not experience an acceleration| but rather is in equilibrium with its environment.,science| branch| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics,,,,,,
acceleration,y,y,The rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration,,a,,,,
force,y,y,Influence that can cause an object to change its velocity unless counterbalanced by other forces.,fundamentals| mechanics| concept,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force,,F,,,,
frame of reference,y,y,Abstract coordinate system whose origin| orientation| and scale are specified by a set of reference pointsâ€“geometric points whose position is identified both mathematically and physically.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference,reference frame,,,,,
impulse,y,y,Change in momentum of an object.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_(physics),,J,,,,
inertia,y,y,Tendency of object in motion to stay in motion and objects at rest to stay at rest.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia,moment of inertia,,,,,
weight,y,y,Force acting on an object due to acceleration of gravity.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight,,W,N,,,
mass,y,y,Intrinsic property of a body. Believed to be related to the quantity of matter in a body| until the discovery of the atom and particle physics. It was found that different atoms and different elementary particles| theoretically with the same amount of matter| have different masses.,fundamentals| mechanics| property,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass,,m,,,,
momentum,y,y,Product of the mass and velocity of an object.,fundamentals| mechanics| newton,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum,,p,,,,
space,y,y,Three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space,,,,,,
speed,y,y,The magnitude of the change of its position over time.,fundamentals| mechanics| kinematics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed,,,,,,
time,y,y,Continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past| through the present| and into the future. It is component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events| to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them| and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension| along three spatial dimensions.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time,,t,,,,
torque,y,y,Rotational analogue of linear force. It is also referred to as the moment of force| or abbreviated to moment. Just as a linear force is a push or pull applied to a body| a torque can be thought of as twist applied to an object with respect to a chosen point.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque,,,,,,
velocity,y,y,The speed in combination with the direction of motion of an object.,fundamentals| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity,,v,,,,
newton,y,y,The unit of force in the international system of units (SI). One newton is| the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second squared in the direction of the applied force.,unit of measurement| mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit),,N,,,,
first law of motion,y,y,A body remains at rest| or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line| except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.,mechanics| law,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion,,,,,,
second law of motion,y,y,At any instant of time| the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or| equivalently| the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.,mechanics| law,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion,,,,,,
